= Pending Design Decisions =

This is a proposal of things, which should be changed in the near future, but i'm open for comments on the decisions:

  * ~~rename `VersionizedTextField()` to `RcsTextField()` to better match the project name~~(done)
  * ~~let every field be able to report it's available and it's changed versions (api change)~~(done but adds a new feature request)
  * a model should be able to provide all versions at which *any* field changed.

API example:

{{{
>>> b = A.objects.get(pk=1)
>>> c = A.objects.get(pk=2)
>>> b.get_content_revisions() #content is the field-name. this works like the get_FOO_display() method for example
[1,2,4,6]
>>> c.get_text_revisions()
[3,5]
}}}
