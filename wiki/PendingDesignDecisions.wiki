= Pending Design Decisions =

This is a proposal of things, which should be changed in the near future, but i'm open for comments on the decisions:

  * rename `VersionizedTextField()` to `RcsTextField()` to better match the project name
  * let every field be able to report it's available and it's changed versions (api change)

API example:

{{{
>>> b = A.objects.get(pk=1)
>>> c = A.objects.get(pk=2)
>>> b.rcsfield1.get_revisions()
[1,2,3,4,5,6]
>>> b.rcsfield2.get_revisions()
[1,2,3,4,5,6]
>>> b.rcsfield1.get_changed_revisions()
[2,4]
>>> b.rcsfield2.get_changed_revisions()
[3,5]
>>> b.get_revisions()
[1,2,3,4,5,6]
>>> b.get_changed_revisions()
[2,3,4,5]
>>> c.get_changed_revisions()
[1,6]
}}}
